F:: Woah, a stranger! Looks like you popped out of nowhere - welcome to <EvilCreeper321’s Farm>. What’s your name-
S:: Shut it! Don’t know what you are, but stay away! Hostiles approaching in multiple directions.
F:: Oh, okay, uh-
S:: Gut feeling tells me they’ll hurt you way more than me while I’m in … whatever liminal space this is, so I said STAY AWAY!
F:: Oh, okay, alright, got it! What’s your name, by the way? My name is Frieda-
S:: Can you SAVE this for after we are done?
--
S:: Phew. Got rid of that wave for now, at least. No doubt more of those will show, though …
F:: Woah … what were those?
S:: Hexbots. Run into a lot of those where I come from.
F:: It’s alright, … I’m just glad you were here! I can’t even THINK of what would have happened to me if you weren’t here to save me.
S:: Ah, uh … thanks. And the name’s Sam, by the way.
F:: Sam! Nice to meet you, Sam. I’d love to talk more about you and what all this is … but you said more of them would appear, right?
S:: Yeah. We’re going to need to shore up this place with solid defenses to buy some time. What firepower do you have on tap? 
S:: Surveillance drones? Laser grids? Automated turrets?
F:: What’s a … surveillance drone? Is that a new type of bee?
S:: ... alright, different tack. What do you have, Frieda?
F:: Oh! Well, we have a lot of things, really! I actually do quite a lot of work around <EvilCreeper321’s Farm>. 
F:: Tending to the crops, building fences …
S:: ... we’ll just have to make do with that, then.
F:: Anything to help, Sam! I can get us started with that!
--
F:: Can I help you in any way? What you’re doing seems so dangerous!
S:: Uhh … why don’t you just keep doing your, uh, farm thing and help me move around? 
S:: Wherever we are, the … physics of this place doesn’t agree with me, so I’ll need your help. 
F:: You’re right … you don’t look like you belong here, Sam - not that that’s a bad thing! 
F:: <EvilCreeper321’s Farm> is a welcome home for everyone - so you can count on me to be there for you!
S:: ... great. Anyways, stay sharp, hostiles are on the move.
