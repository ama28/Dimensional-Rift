F:: Those, uh ... creatures sure look strange, huh?
S:: ...
F:: I'm too used to seeing, you know, cows and chickens and-
S:: Trying to focus here, Frieda. Keep the rambling short?
F:: Oh, okay.
--
S:: What's with the orientation here?
F:: Orientation? What do you mean?
S:: My movement, here, it's - it's all off. You all look off.
F:: Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry?
S:: Sure. I'm just complaining, you don't have to apologize.
F:: Ah, I'm sorry for apologizing-oh, I didn't mean to do it again, I'm-
S:: Let's just cut it here before you confuse yourself too much, alright?
--
S:: Can't believe I got saddled with babysitting a civilian here.
F:: I wish you didn't have to. All this monster stuff is-
S:: It's a liability having you around when you can't manage a fight. 
S:: You're lucky you can at least build stuff here, slow them down.
F:: I'd like to think so! Building things keeps me calm.
S:: Then keep doing it and stay out of my way if you want to keep living.
F:: Okay!

F:: I'm used to collecting my coins, but these ones look a bit weird ...
S:: That's a Power Unit. It's what's keeping those monsters ticking inside.
F:: And you ... buy and sell with these?
S:: Only anything dangerous. 
F:: I'll, uh, give you these if I collect them then.
S:: Good choice.
--
S:: You're sure hard at work with the crops.
F:: It's how we live and trade! That's the way we get anything done here.
S:: We might die to another wave of enemies by the time they grow, you know.
F:: But it's worth it if it gives you a chance of protecting us!
--
S:: All this, happening because of a rookie mistake. Xyzzy would laugh at me.
F:: Mistake?
S:: Jumping into portals you don't know. This sort of thing's too unpredictable.
S:: And now I'm here, where everything looks weird and distorted.
F:: I don't think the farm looks that distorted ...
S:: I'm stuck here. This is hell.
--
F:: Hey, what's your favorite color?
S:: Uh, me? Uh-
F:: Ooh, ooh, let me guess! It's pink, right?
S:: ... yeah, sure, let's go with that.
