S:: Wish I had more power, you know?
F:: To fight the monsters? But you're doing great.
S:: No, not like that - I just mean, like ... in general. More than all this fighting.
S:: I mean ... imagine the world at your fingertips. No need to shoot, to run, everything just ... it works for you.
F:: That's how I feel with this farm, Sam - this is my world! Everything here is something I can do something about. 
F:: When I build a fence and it's done, nothing feels nicer than knowing things here are the way I want.
S:: You know, you might have just converted me over to actually appreciating this whole farming business.
S:: Some peace sounds real tempting right about now.

F:: Hey, Sam? Maybe I've asked this before, but what's your favorite color?
S:: What do you think?
F:: ... I might be wrong, but I think it's green.
S:: How did you- there's no way you just guessed that.
F:: Well, when we're building, I just see you staring at the grass and trees so often, you know ...
S:: ... You don't get to see greens this vibrant where I come from. You're really lucky, you know, Frieda?
F:: I know! I'm glad that you get to experience this too - everyone deserves to appreciate nature.

S:: Hey, Frieda?
F:: Yeah?
S:: ... this whole situation sucks, but I'm glad you're here.
F:: I'm glad you're here too, Sam!

S:: What do you think you'll leave behind when you die, Frieda?
F:: Oh, that's a morbid question, Sam ... are you doing okay?
S:: Just a random question. Don't worry too hard about it.
F:: Well ... I see it as planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.
S:: Strange analogy, but I guess that's the farming in you speaking.
F:: Yeah! Isn't it nice to know that the small things you do now can be so majestic in the future?
S:: ... yeah. I wonder what I'm leaving behind except burnt bridges and violence sometimes.
F:: If it's any consolation, you've left some wonderful memories with me here.
